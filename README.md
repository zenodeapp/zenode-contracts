# ZENODE Contracts

A light-sized repository aiming to bundle commonly used Solidity contracts, libraries and helper functions together.

This has been built by ZENODE and is licensed under the MIT-license (see [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md)).

## Overview

### Contracts

  - Create ownable contracts
  - Adding and removing of administrators
  - Limiting read/write access
  - Ownership transference

### Libraries

\-

### Helpers

- [hardhat.js](helpers/hardhat.js) helper functions.

## Getting Started

Including this repository in your projects can be done in multiple ways:

- Adding it as a Git submodule to your project (recommended)
- Adding it as an npm module
- Git cloning (or downloading as a .zip)

### Add as a Git submodule

This is the approach I personally recommend for it clearly shows that this repository is a subset of your project. It could also give insight to which commit we're currently on and whether there have been changes to the <i>sub-repository</i>.

1. **Clone and stage the submodule**

   ```
   git submodule add -b main https://github.com/zenodeapp/zenode-contracts.git <destination_folder>
   ```

   > <i>\<destination_folder\></i> can be omitted, this will clone the repo in the current directory inside a folder named `zenode-contracts`.

2. **Commit and push**

   ```
   git commit -a -m "Added submodule zenode-contracts.git"
   git push
   ```

3. **Updating submodules (for in the future)**

   To pull and incorporate the most recent changes, run this command inside the root of your main repository:

   ```
   git submodule update --remote --recursive <path_to_submodule>
   ```

   > Omit  <i>\<path_to_submodule\></i> to update every submodule.

### Add as an npm module

This repository hasn't been registered as an npm module, but can be added as a dependency using a package manager of your choosing.

```
npm install zenodeapp/zenode-contracts
```

```
yarn add zenodeapp/zenode-contracts
```

> The syntax is <i>\<User name\></i>/<i>\<Repository name\></i>, which might be different for other package manager tools.

If you're interested in a specific branch, commit or tag, run the following command instead:

```
npm install zenodeapp/zenode-contracts#<branch/commit/tag>
```

```
yarn add zenodeapp/zenode-contracts#<branch/commit/tag>
```

Do have in mind that updating modules the way you're used to with your package manager will probably not work with git packages. Re-install the package instead if you wish to pull the most recent changes to your project.

### Add by downloading or cloning

- Download .zip file on Github (top-right):
  
  ![download-zip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108588903/197372280-df92e403-0805-4095-86b5-433f88773b52.png)

- Or, clone the repository using the command line:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/zenodeapp/zenode-contracts.git <destination_folder>
  ```

  > Cloning creates a directory with the same name as the repo in the specified folder.
  >
  > > If you want to clone into the folder you're currently in, use '.' instead:
  > >
  > > ```
  > > git clone https://github.com/zenodeapp/zenode-contracts.git .
  > > ```
